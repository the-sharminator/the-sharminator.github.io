      <h3>Your name</h3>
      <p>Hi, my name is Will. I'm 24 years old, and I'm a first year student on the MSci Computer Science with Cyber Security programme at City, University of London. For the past couple of years I've been working at a construction company as a Project Controls Assistant, which I am now doing part time, in addition to the course.
      
      In this role I've been responsbile for helping to develop, deploy, and maintain the various solutions that our projects use to capture, store, and leverage their data. I've come to realise that Computer Science (and Cyber Secruity in partciular) is what I'm really passionate about, however, and as the majority of the work we do is 'low-code', there is no real opportunity to learn about these things within the scope of my job. Given this, I've been attempting to learn and develop these skills in my own time as much as possible through a number of personal projects. These have included some (rather unsuccessful) automated crypto-currency trading and data analysis using python, mobile app development using Flutter, and some very basic hacking using sites like the excellent 'Hack the Box'. I have often struggled to find as much time for all of this as I would have liked though, and its for that reason that I finally decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science!</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Forest scene</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of arrays, loops, and randomness. I created a forest scene in which 
	details of each tree (e.g. position, trunk color and size, crown color and shape) 
	are stored in parallel 2D arrays. Trees are arranged in a regular grid but their 
	positions are jittered by  small random offsets to create the impression of a real 
	forest. Similarly, each tree trunk and crown has a individual color shade, obtained
	using  random variations of brown and green. Finally, the forest changes over time:
	trees grow and their crowns become more pale to suggest seasonal change ( from 
        spring to autumn).
