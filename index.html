      <h3>William Sharman</h3>
      <p>Hi, my name is Will. I'm 24 years old, and I'm a first year student on the MSci Computer Science with Cyber Security programme at City, University of London. For the past couple of years I've been working at a construction company as a Project Controls Assistant, which I am now doing part time, in addition to the course.<br><br>In this role I've been responsbile for helping to develop, deploy, and maintain the various solutions that our projects use to capture, store, and leverage their data. I've come to realise that Computer Science (and Cyber Secruity in partciular) is what I'm really passionate about, however, and as the majority of the work we do is 'low-code', there is no real opportunity to learn about these things within the scope of my job. Given this, I've been attempting to learn and develop these skills in my own time as much as possible through a number of personal projects. These have included some (rather unsuccessful) automated crypto-currency trading and data analysis using python, mobile app development using Flutter, and some very basic hacking using sites like the excellent 'Hack the Box'. I have often struggled to find as much time for all of this as I would have liked though, and its for that reason that I finally decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science!</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Zenga</h3>
    <p>
    For my Bootcamp project I decided to try and recreate the game Jenga in processing. I chose this project because I thought it would present some interesting problems which would require creative solutions, in particular, working out the physics of whether or not the tower should collapse at any given point. It also provided a good opportunity to practice using Classes, Arrays, and Loops. The project is split into two parts: a simple menu screen, and the game itself. The menu screen displays the controls for the game - we can use the WASD keys to move around, f to pick up or place a block, r to reset the tower, and space to open or close the menu. I've tried to keep the actual game as simple and intuitive as possible. The currently selected block is highlighted in white. Pressing f will pick it up, after which you can move it to a new position, and press f again to place it. Each time you pick up or place a block, the game will calculate whether or not the tower should collapse. When it does, you can simply press r to reset it and start again. You can view more information about this project, and the code itself on my github profile - a link to which you can find below. You can also find a video demo of the game <a href="https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/5a408eb3-1558-470f-81e4-e6bd40c75348">here</a>.
